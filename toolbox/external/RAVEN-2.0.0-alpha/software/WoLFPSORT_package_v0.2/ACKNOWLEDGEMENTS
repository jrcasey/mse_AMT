ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


1. DATA

Uniprot: The vast majority of the training data for WoLF PSORT comes from Uniprot (www.pir.uniprot.org) (formerly Swiss Prot).

Gene Ontology: In addition, a significant number of plant entries were derived from the Gene Ontology web site (www.geneontology.org).


2. RESEARCH

WoLF PSORT has been influenced by several works. In particular, it 
directly builds on PSORT/PSORTII and iPSORT.

PSORT & PSORTII
Nakai, K. and Horton, P., PSORT: a program for detecting the sorting signals of proteins and predicting their subcellular localization, Trends Biochem. Sci, 24(1) 34-35 (1999)

iPSORT
Bannai, H., Tamada, Y., Maruyama, O., Nakai, K., and Miyano, S., Extensive feature detection of N-terminal protein sorting signals, Bioinformatics 18(2), 298-305 (2002)


3. SOFTWARE

The initial job handling code for web server was designed by C.J. Collier
(Under contract for AIST).

This project was developed using numerous free software tools. An
incomplete list includes: gnu debian linux, g++, gdb, cvs, Perl, Mason, 
Apache and Emacs.
