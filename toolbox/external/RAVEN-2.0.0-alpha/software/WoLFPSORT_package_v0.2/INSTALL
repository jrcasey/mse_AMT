Targets: "runWolfPsortSummary" and "runWolfPsortHtmlTables"

To install:


1. Copy the binaries from the appropriate platform specific binary
   directory ./bin/binByPlatform/binary-? to ./bin/

For example, a pentium user would use

  % cp bin/binByPlatform/binary-i386/* bin/

Now "runWolfPsortSummary" should work.


The next step is for "runWolfPsortHtmlTables", but can be skipped
if you use the --no-psort-classical-prediction.
For more info try:

  % runWolfPsortHtmlTables --man

or if you like Japanese:

  % export LANG=ja_JP.eucjp
  % runWolfPsortHtmlTables --man


2. % cd ./bin/psortModifiedForWolfFiles
   % ./psortModifiedForWoLF -t all.seq

Depending on the version of dbm installed on your machine, this
should either produce the files:

attribute.dir, attribute.pag, locat.dir, locat.pag, range.dir, range.pag

or simply:

attribute, locat, range.


3. Move the entire installation subdirectory as is to where you want.

The Perl wrappers should work as long as the relative location of
the files are maintained.


OPTIONAL

4. copy the files in ./man/man1 to where you put your man pages. For example
   % sudo cp -i ./man/man1/*.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1
   % sudo mandb
   % apropos localization


TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION

There is no test suite, but you can see if your results match those found in REGRESSION


TROUBLESHOOTING

The latest version 0.2 of WoLF PSORT uses some Perl modules such as
Getopt::Long, Pod::Usage, etc.

Perhaps because of this, it does not work with ancient Perl
versions. It does not work with 5.005_03.  It does work with v5.8.4.
I am not sure about what happens in between.
