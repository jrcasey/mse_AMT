START

Please first read this documents:

  ./CITATION
  ./INSTALL


EXECUTION

This package contains two scripts to be directly executed:

  ./bin/runWolfPsortSummaryOnly, and ./bin/runWolfPsortHtmlTables


For a simple, text based, summarized prediction result use:

  ./bin/runWolfPsortSummaryOnly.pl fungi < ./bin/testQuery.fasta


For a more elaborate and informative html version use:

  ./bin/runWolfPsortHtmlTables.pl fungi testOut/ queryName < ./bin/testQuery.fasta

In this case the results will be written to the directory "testOut/"
(which use should create first, the script will not create it for you.

To view the results point an html browser at testOut/htdocs/results/queryName.html
